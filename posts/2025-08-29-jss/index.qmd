The paper **nonprobsvy -- An R package for modern methods for
non-probability surveys** ([arxiv
version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04255)) written by Piotr Chlebicki
and Maciej Beręsewicz was accepted to the Journal of Statistical
Software!

Here's the abstract of this paper:

*The paper presents nonprobsvy – an R package for inference based on
non-probability samples. The package implements various approaches that
can be categorized into three groups: prediction-based approach, inverse
probability weighting and doubly robust approach. In the package, we
assume the existence of either population-level data or
probability-based population information and leverage the survey package
for inference. The package implements both analytical and bootstrap
variance estimation for the proposed estimators. In the paper we present
the theory behind the package, its functionalities and a case study that
showcases the usage of the package. The package is aimed at scientists
and researchers who would like to use non-probability samples (e.g., big
data, opt-in web panels, social media) to accurately estimate population
characteristics.*
