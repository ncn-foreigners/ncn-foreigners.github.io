## Abstract

Entity resolution (probabilistic record linkage, deduplication) is
essential for estimation based on multiple sources. It aims to link
records without common identifiers that refer to the same entity (e.g.,
person, company). Without identifiers, researchers must specify which
records to compare to calculate matching probability and reduce
computational complexity. Traditional deterministic blocking uses common
variables like first letters of names, sex, or dates of birth, but
assumes error-free, complete data. To address this limitation, we
developed the R package **blocking**, which uses approximate nearest
neighbor search and graph algorithms to reduce the number of
comparisons. This paper presents the package design, functionalities,
and two case studies.
