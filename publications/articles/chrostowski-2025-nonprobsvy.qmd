## Abstract

The following paper presents nonprobsvy -- an R package
for inference based on non-probability samples. The package implements
various approaches that can be categorized into three groups:
prediction-based approach, inverse probability weighting and doubly
robust approach. In the package, we assume the existence of either
population-level data or probability-based population information and
leverage the survey package for inference. The package implements
both analytical and bootstrap variance estimation for the proposed
estimators. In the paper we present the theory behind the package, its
functionalities and case study that showcases the usage of the package.
The package is aimed at scientists and researchers who would like to use
non-probability samples (e.g. big data, opt-in web panels, social media)
to accurately estimate population characteristics.
