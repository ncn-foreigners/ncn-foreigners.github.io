He expects to graduate in the spring of 2023 with a B.A. in psychology and sociology. Furthermore, he intends to pursue higher studies in either clinical or counseling psychology.\nResearch interests include: Mental health, counseling, and different clinical and counseling intervention methods. Patterns of thinking and maladaptive schemas, assessing the psychological functioning of individuals during depressive episodes and recovery periods. What exactly leads to depressive thoughts and thinking, and how do escape such episodes. How do depressed individuals cope with varying levels of depression while being on or off medicine? The role of personality type, personality disorder, and family upbringing in shaping one’s worldview and ways of dealing with stress, stressors, and negative emotions. Is all the theoretical side of psychology bad/hard to measure nowadays? How much of Freudian and Jungian theory still holds today? How valid and reliable is it to combine theoretical and clinically proven techniques together? How big is the room for improvisation in clinical settings?\nFinally, can a healthy lifestyle with a supporting circle of friends and loved ones and dedication to a hobby or holding a job that one is passionate about being able to supplant the role of medication? What if one is diagnosed with clinical depression and is unable to function while being medicated? What is the best way to lessen the symptoms of such an individual?"

    "text": "Abstract\nImplementing a computerized facial expression analysis system for automatic coding requires that a threshold for the system’s classifier outputs be selected. However, there are many potential ways to select a threshold. How do different criteria and metrics compare? Manually FACS coded video of 45 clinical interviews (Spectrum dataset) were processed using person-specific active appearance models (AAM). Support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were trained using an independent dataset (RU-FACS). Spectrum sessions were randomly assigned to training (n=32) and testing sets (n=13). Six different threshold selection criteria were compared for automatic AU coding. Three major findings emerged: 1) Thresholds that attempt to balance the confusion matrix (using kappa, \\(F_1\\), or MCC) performed significantly better on all metrics than thresholds that select arbitrary error or accuracy rates (such as TPR, FPR, or EER). 2) AU detection scores for kappa, \\(F_1\\), and MCC were highly intercorrelated; accuracy was uncorrelated with the others. And 3) Kappa, MCC, and \\(F_1\\) were all positively correlated with base rate. They increased with increases in AU base rates. Accuracy, by contrast, showed the opposite pattern. It was strongly negatively correlated with base rate. These findings suggest that better automatic coding can be obtained by using threshold-selection criteria that balance the confusion matrix and benefit from increased AU base rates in the training data."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe use of non-probability data sources for statistical purposes and for official statistics has become increasingly popular in recent years. However, statistical inference based on non-probability samples is made more difficult by nature of their biasedness and lack of representativity. In this paper we propose quantile balancing inverse probability weighting estimator (QBIPW) for non-probability samples. We apply the idea of Harms and Duchesne (2006) allowing the use of quantile information in the estimation process to reproduce known totals and the distribution of auxiliary variables. We discuss the estimation of the QBIPW probabilities and its variance. Our simulation study has demonstrated that the proposed estimators are robust against model mis-specification and, as a result, help to reduce bias and mean squared error. Finally, we applied the proposed methods to estimate the share of job vacancies aimed at Ukrainian workers in Poland using an integrated set of administrative and survey data about job vacancies."
